<h3>"Build your own customized tour on the Internet"</h3>
</center>
Summary:
<blockquote>This document describes the requirements for a
Internet based tour-building system.
<p>There are three components to this system:</p>
<ol>
	<li>A web-based tour-building system</li>

	<li>An XML based tour-component data supply system</li>

	<li>The technology component (Hardware, Software, Channels, etc)</li>
</ol>
Although, my main focus is selling the technology components, this
document will focus on the "Tour-building" system, to allow me to
correctly design the technology and back-end systems.
<p>The "Tour-building system" is an Internet-based web site which
allows the customer to easily shop and compare tour products, build a
customized tour from a pre-existing template or from scratch, and make
any changes. The customer can check product descriptions, pricing, and
availability. Then, they can save or book their tour and provide payment
information. The web site would then be used to check payment status and
comfirmation information for each component and allow modifications or
cancellations before and during their tour. Post-tour, this system could
be used to provide fellow users with product-reviews or to process
refunds and adjustments.</p>
<p>The tour-building system requires data from vendors. The data is
supplied from the tour-component systems, and should be in a open,
publicly-available, standardized format. The "server-side" of this
system is an order fulfillment system for tour companies.</p>
<p>The technology component deals with physical hosting of the
tour-builder, hosting of the tour-component supply systems, target
customers, and sales channels for these systems.</p>
</blockquote>
Points:
<blockquote>
<li>The "Tour Builder" should be simple enough for an end-user to
user over the Internet intuitively.</li>

<li>The tour data should be accessed directly from Vendor's web
sites to provide accurate and immediate response.</li>

<li>Product delivery should be flexible--from direct, wholesale, or
resale channels.</li>

<li>Feedback should be provided to supply reviews for future
customers.</li>

<li>Vendor interfaces should use open (non-proprietary) interfaces.</li>

<li>How am I gonna make any money on this?</li>
