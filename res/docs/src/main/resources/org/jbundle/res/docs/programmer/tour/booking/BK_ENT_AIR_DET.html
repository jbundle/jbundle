<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>When you first enter this program, the basic air for the program that you selected will automatically
be displayed.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>At this point, you can make any changes to the air info. If this is a modification to existing air, the
previous basic air for this booking (the pax air modifications remain unchanged) is saved (including
passenger modifications).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>To return the information to the basic information, just enter DEL at the CHANGE AT ITEM
prompt. This deletes the current and restores the basic air (although the pax mods would have to be
re-entered). Typing delete at a passenger mod will only delete the passenger air.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If you answer Yes to the INV prompt, the current air inventory for this segment will display.
