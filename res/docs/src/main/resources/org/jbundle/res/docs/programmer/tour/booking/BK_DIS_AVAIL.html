<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Enter a group series tour code and a starting departure date. All tours departures will display in
departure date order.

<p>	Note: This program is very similar to the tour availability display (which can also be used). The difference is
this display also gives you the tour status at each departure, so cancelled or blocked departures will
stand out.
