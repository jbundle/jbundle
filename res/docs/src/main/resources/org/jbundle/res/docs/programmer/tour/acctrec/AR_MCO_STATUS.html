<p>Program Description:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This program displays the current status of an MCO.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>You can access an MCO either by the booking number, or the actual MCO number. Entering the first
numbers of the MCO number will display all matching MCOs in order.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If there are more than one MCOs for one booking, then they will all display.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If the MCO has not been posted to the General Ledger yet, the amounts may be changed. The
amounts may only be changed for report use, the actual amount posted to the booking may not be
changed.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If the amount posted to a booking is incorrect, first change the MCO information to the correct values,
so the MCO submission will be correct, then enter a credit or debit memo to the booking with
distribution to the MCO variance account. This will insure all entries are correct.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>For example:

<p>MCO net should have been $900, but was posted as $1000.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>First, change the MCO amount to 1000. Then enter a debit memo for $100. The booking will show
the correct amount. If the carrier pays $1000, the G/L entries will be:

<p>Cash			1000.00

<p>	A/R MCOs			900.00

<p>	MCO Variances		100.00

<p>The debit memo will produce:

<p>MCO Variance	100.00

<p>	Accounts Receivable	100.00

<p>leaving all accounts in the correct state.
