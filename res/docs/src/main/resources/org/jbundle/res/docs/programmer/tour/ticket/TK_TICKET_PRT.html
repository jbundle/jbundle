<p>Program Description:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This program prints the tickets entered on automated ticket stock. The ticket numbers and issue dates
will automatically be stored so they will print in the weekly ticket report.

<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Enter the ticket number of the first ticket to print, and enter the issue date. All tickets with a "print
ticket" status will print on the ticket printer.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>To review the tickets to print, use the Display tickets by status display in booking entry.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Remember, header tickets will not print, only tickets written to specific persons. After printing, the
status on the ticket will be updated to "Ticketed" and the issue date and ticket number will be filled
in.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Note: If you have made a mistake and a ticket did not print out correctly, you may go into the booking
and re-request the ticket to be printed (remember to clear the issue date and the ticket number). Once
the ARC update has been done, you can't re-request the same ticket to be printed.
