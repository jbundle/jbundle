<p>Program Description:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This program maintains the basic ticket information for all the passengers on a booking.

<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>When you first enter this program, the basic ticket information for the program that you selected will
automatically be displayed.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>At this point, you can make any changes to the ticket info. If this is a modification to existing air, the
previous basic air for this booking (the pax air modifications remain unchanged) is saved (including
passenger modifications).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If you are changing a ticket which has already been ticketed, you will have to change the Issue/Change
date to the date the ticket was changed. Then the ARC report knows which ARC report to include the
changed ticket on.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If you void or exchange a ticket, enter Yes under the void question and enter the void/refund date.
Then enter the ticket number that the ticket was exhanged for under Exch. Ticket number.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>To return the information to the basic information, just enter DEL at the CHANGE AT ITEM
prompt. This deletes the current and restores the basic air (although the pax mods would have to be
re-entered). Typing delete at a passenger mod will only delete the passenger air. Remember, typing
"DEL" will also clear the air detail even though it isn't displayed on this screen.
