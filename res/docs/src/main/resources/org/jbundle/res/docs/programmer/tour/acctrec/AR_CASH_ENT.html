<p>Program Description:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This program is used to enter all incoming checks for tours (both deposits and final payments).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Usually this program is easy to operate because the payment is returned with the confirmation payment
stub. The stub has the booking number printed on it, making receipt entry very simple.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>You can either enter the booking number if you know it, or you can hit return and enter the agency's
ARC number; which will display all unpaid bookings. Select the correct booking from this display to
continue.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>To enter a non-tour related cash receipt, enter a booking number of zero.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>For each check received, you have to enter the check number, ABA number (If deposit slips are
printed), and check amount. The check amount defaults to the deposit amount for the initial payment
and the outstanding balance for subsequent payments.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The amount to apply will automatically default to the check amount. To enter a different amount, just
change the field at the CHANGE ITEM prompt. This is used to distribute one check between several
bookings. After entering the first distribution, enter the booking number of the other booking and the
original check number. Change the distribution amount to the amount to be applied to this booking.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This program is also used to do cash receipts changes and deletions. If a check is found from the same
agency with the same check number, then the system will display the current cash receipts.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Once a deposit is received, the booking's internal status is changed to "Accepted" and the A/R detail
is set-up.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The A/R account that is credited is the one that is listed in the booking record. The A/R account in
the booking record comes from the tour header.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If the cash receipt is not for a tour (booking no = 0) then the A/R number must be entered under #5
on the screen (defaults to non-tour A/R in A/R control file.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>For example, the G/L entry for a batch of checks might be:

<p>6/21/90  Cash - Trust Account		22.50

<p>			Bank Service Charges		22.50
