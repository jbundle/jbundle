<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Enter the currency range and the cut-off date. The report will include the cost for all tours which
depart on this date or before, but were not paid (and may not yet be paid) until after the cutoff date.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The report will read the A/P detail for each vendor. If the departure date of the tour is on or before
the cutoff date, then the item is analyzed.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>-	If the item is a finalization estimate, it is skipped.

<p>-	If the item is a Departure estimate, then the estimated cost is included on the report.

<p>-	If the item is a Invoice, then the invoiced cost is included on the report. If any payments were
made before the cut-off date, they are subtracted from the invoice amount.

<p>-	If the item is a paid Invoice, then it is included only if payments were made AFTER the cut-off
date. (If the invoice was paid before the cut-off date, the cost is included in the cash receipts
journal) - Credit memo's are handled exactly as invoices (if associated with a tour)

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Note:	This program is usually used when the G/L interface is not being used. The total on this report
is estimated tour cost and will be included as a cost of tours if you are on an accrual basis.
