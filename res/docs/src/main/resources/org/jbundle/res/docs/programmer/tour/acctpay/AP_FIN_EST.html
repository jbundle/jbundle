<p>Program Description:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>A finalization estimate is the estimate of the tour cost, based on the number of passengers and services
at the tour finalization date. Tour orders are usually sent to the vendors on this same day.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The amounts entered here have NO effect on the accounting system. They are entered only to help
estimate the amount of currency which will be required for payment in the future.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>First, type in the tour number. The tour description will display automatically.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Now you can enter all of the services and estimated costs for this tour.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>For each vendor providing services on this tour, enter the description of the services (ie., 2 Transfers,
SS), the beginning and ending dates, the tour finalization date (defaults to today's date), and the
estimate amount (in the vendor's local currency).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>After entering each estimate, the cursor will return to item #2 on the screen. This lets you enter all of
the finalization estimates for each tour.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>To clear the information just entered, type DEL at the CHANGE ITEM prompt.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>To enter estimates for the next tour, just press return at the vendor position (#2) and you will be able
to enter more estimates, or end the program by hitting return again.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If you want to change a current finalization estimate, use the A/P adjustments screen. Since
finalizations estimates are not posted, they may be freely changed.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Take a look at the currency requirements report. This will give you a good idea of what this data is
used for.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Note: This program will rarely be used, becase the data supplied wouldn't justify the time that the user would
have to spend putting the data into the system.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The data for finalization estimates will almost always be supplied by the booking sub-system.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This program would be used to enter a rare manual booking that might have a significant future impact
on the cash flow.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>For Finalization estimates transferred from the booking system, the entry number is the voucher
number! When the booking system prints a voucher/tour order this number is printed on the
voucher/tour order.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Warning: Remember that the tour finalization program automatically creates finalization estimates. If you
enter a finalization estimate before the finalization date, the tour finalization program will NOT create
or update the estimate for the services that you have entered. (This means that tour orders and other
documents will not be created, because the system can't be sure which booking in a tour contains the
correct land or hotel detail)

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Note: After a finalization estimate has been entered, it cannot be deleted. Since a finalization estimate
is non-accountable, this should not pose a problem. However, if you do want to delete a finalization
estimate, go to departure estimate entry, enter a departure estimate amount. Then, immediately re-enter the estimate number and type DEL at the CHANGE ITEM prompt.
