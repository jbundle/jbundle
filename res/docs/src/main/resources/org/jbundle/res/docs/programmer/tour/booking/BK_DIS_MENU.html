<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>When you enter this program, the main user defined menu will display. Selecting an item on the menu
will display the menu for the item selected. Pressing return will return you to the previous menu.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Note:	To set up a user defined menu system, just type each menu in the word-processing system and
save them in the following format: The main menu should be called MENU. The menu for
the first selection should be called MENU_1. The menu for the fourth selection on the first
sub-menu would be called MENU_1_4. And so on... All menus should be saved in the
MENU directory (ie., :TRAVEL:MENU)
