<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Enter a valid land code and the current pricing will display.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The "Vary Code" is used to enter different costs. "S" means the Seat-in-Car/Seat-in-Motorcoach
price. If a SIC price exists, the user will be offered a choice of SIC or Private Car/Coach in FIT Land
entry. "0" is the per-person cost; "1" is the single supplement per person, etc... "F" is a fixed
component of the cost to be allocated to all the passengers proportionately. Any other code may be
entered for other variables. (ie., If there is a per-day cost on a Rent-a-Car, you would enter "D" and
the per-day cost--then the user would be asked for the number of days in booking entry)

<p>	Note: Remember the answer to a variable question is a two digit number. If the number requires a larger
number use a larger base (For example, miles X 100)
