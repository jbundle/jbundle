<p>Program Operation:

<p>Enter a tour code and a starting date. If there is already a tour in this range, it will display, otherwise
enter the new tour information.

<p>Note: If a tour is discontinued, but previous tours are still operating, do not delete the header. Just
enter CL as the initial status. This will prevent res agents from booking the tour, but the accounting
system can still retrieve G/L information from the header.
