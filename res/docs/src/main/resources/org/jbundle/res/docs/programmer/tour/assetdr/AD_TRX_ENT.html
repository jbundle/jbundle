<p>Program Description:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This program allows additions to the bank account detail file. This program is used to enter bank
service charges, automatic charges, and any other transaction not handled by the Accounts Receivable
or Accounts Payable system.

<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>First, enter a valid bank account number. Next, enter the Transaction type (C=Check D=Deposit), the
payee, date, amount, and comment.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Once the general account information is entered, you will be asked to enter the G/L distribution.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>After making any changes, you will be asked if the transaction is okay. If it is, the transaction will be
added to the checking detail file. The detail will be added to the G/L distribution file which will be
posted to the G/L at the next posting date.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Note: To enter a void check, just enter a check with an amount of zero and a payee of VOID. This
will not create any entries, but will maintain the complete list of check numbers for the audit trail.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Note: This program is also used to cancel a check which was lost, etc. Just use the Dr entry mode and
distribute to the original G/L distribution. This will insure the correct amounts in the General Ledger.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Note: When entering transactions which have been entered in another system, remember that a G/L
transaction will also be created in the other system. For example, a check received in A/R is returned
by the bank; First, you would enter a debit memo in credit/memo entry, then you would enter a credit
in this program. The G/L entry created by A/R would be:

<p>4/15/91	Accounts Receivable			200.00

<p>			Returned Check Summary		200.00

<p>The G/L entry created by this program would be:

<p>4/15/91	Returned Check Summary		200.00

<p>			Cash						200.00
