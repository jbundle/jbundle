<p>Program Description:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This program is used to package invoices, prepayments requests, and credit memos for payment.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This program offers an easy way to select a batch of invoices for the check request program. (For
example, you could select invoices to pay on every Thursday, then at the end of the month, just enter
a check request and all of the invoices selected during the month would be paid)

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The first thing that you must enter in this program is the vendor code. The system displays the current
balance of selected invoices and a list of all of the invoices (whether they are selected or not) and
prepayments, and the amount selected for payment on each invoice. They will be in the order of the
starting service dates.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The system will ask for any changes at the bottom of the screen.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If you select an item on the screen, first the system will display the tour number and description, then
the system will ask you to enter an amount to pay (defaults to the full invoice amount). If you enter
zero, this invoice is de-selected for payment. For prepayment requests you must enter either the
amount requested or zero, partial prepayments are not accepted. Credit invoices must also be selected-in full.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If you type "All" at the Any change prompt, then all the invoices on the screen are selected for full
payment.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>To display the next screen-full of invoices, just hit return. To stop, type "End".

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If you have to pay something that doesn't exist on the display, then you have to exit this program and
enter either an invoice, credit memo, or prepayment request.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This selection can be used to package invoices for a manual check, debit memo, or broker draft.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Note: To see the resulting G/L entries, take a look at the check printing program. This program has no effect
on any balances. Check printing is where the data is updated.
