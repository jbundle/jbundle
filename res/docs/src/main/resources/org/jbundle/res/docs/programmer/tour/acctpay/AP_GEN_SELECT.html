<p>Program Description:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This program is used to automatically generate check requests for a class of vendors.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This program is used to select the payments for all vendors who have a matching payment code. For
example, you may want to send out a check for all prepayment requests every week for any hotels that
require final payment in advance. You may want to pay the general bills every two weeks (UPS, etc),
or you may want to send a prepayment check to a frequently used tour operator in mid-month for the
current invoice balance.

<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>First, type in the payment code (in the vendor file) to select. These are the vendors who will be
checked for any outstanding invoices, credit memos, or prepayment requests.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Next, Decide whether you would like a hard-copy of everything that was selected. (This is also a
convenient way of finding out what would be selected if you ran the program; Just answer yes to this
question, but don't select any invoices). If you select yes, the report will run immediately.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If you want to request checks for the selection, then the system will also ask for a bank account to
request the checks on.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The system will only request checks for vendors in the currency of the bank account selected. If the
vendor already has a check selected, the amount is changed to the amount of the current selection.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	This program is very useful, even if it is not used to generate payment requests. If can be used
to print a list of all the vendors with selected invoices in a payment class. This could be used
as input to an order for foreign currency drafts.
