<p>This module works in exactly the same fashion as General Journal Entry. The only difference is that
after posting, the transactions are not deleted. When the end of the period comes around, the recurring
jounnal entries should be posted to the General Ledger. Any Variable entries should be reviewed and
the correct amount entered before posting. If the entry is and the transaction has a counter-balance,
auto-distribution, or accrual-reversal, the extra entries will be made using the amounts entered.
