<p>This screen is used to enter tours made up of basic tour components. This is needed because basic
tours can't be added to tour detail alone. They must be the detail part of a tour entry, so when the
number of passengers on a tour is finalized, the system knows the basic tour configuration.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>For example, If the tour ends up with 39 people, the system would know to order 1 bus (30) and 1
mini-bus (10) for 31-40 people.
