<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Enter a valid message referece number to get a current message, or enter zero to start a new message.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Enter a vendor code or enter a space to manually enter the information. If you enter a space, the fax
information will default to the agency on the current booking.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Then type the message in the space provided, or enter the file name of the file to send (must have been
created by you).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>To send a fax without the standard company information at the top, change #9 to Yes.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>To send your message immediately, type number 21.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Note: To send a WordPerfect file, you must first get rid of the special formatting (such as bold,
underline, etc). To do this, you must use the Text In/Out function in WordPerfect: First invoke Text
In/Out (Ctrl-F5), then select number 1 (Save); Save the file in the :TELEX directory (ie.,
:TELEX:TEXT_ITIN), then in message entry use this file name (TEXT_ITIN in this example).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Note: To send any computer print-outs (Invoices, Reports, etc.) just enter the message, go to number
20 (Text entry) and use list-files using this template: :PRINT:REPORT+YOURNAME. Retrieve the
appropriate print-out, save and exit.
