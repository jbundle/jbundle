<p>Program Description:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This program is used to automatically set up the format for the Financial Statements.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>After the Chart-of-Accounts have been set-up, you can use this program to build a default set-up for
your Financial Statements. Later, if you change the Chart of Accounts, you can use this program to
add or delete the changes to the Financial Statement's formats.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Upon entering this program, enter the statement number (as entered in Statement Maintenance) for
the Balance Sheet and the Income Statment. Any account which has Yes under "Close at year-end"
will be included in the Income Statement, the others will put into the Balance Sheet.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If the statements have already been set-up, any new accounts will be added to the appropriate
statment.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>After running this program, you will have to go to the Statement Formatting program to fix the
sequence of the accounts and to reposition accounts on any other statements.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Note: If the Financial Statements have already been set up and there have been no changes in the
Chart of Accounts, then this program will have no effect on the Financial Statement formats,
although the sequence numbers will be renumbered, making future changes easier.
