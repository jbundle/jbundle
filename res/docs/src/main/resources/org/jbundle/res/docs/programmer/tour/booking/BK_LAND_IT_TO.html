<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>First, this program displays which itinerary versions have already been entered.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Then, you can enter a one letter code to modify or enter a new itinerary description. Itinerary
descriptions are word processing files kept in the :itin directory under the name of the tour code
followed be the one letter version code. For example the main itinerary for HKGS1 would be
ITIN:HKGS1. The alternate itinerary might be :ITIN:HKGS1_A.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Next, the default descriptions to appear on tour orders are displayed. You will have a chance to change
them at this point. The default descriptions are: The tour desc for regular; tour desc (Private car) for
PC; and tour desc (Seat-in-coach) for SIC.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If any new questions have been entered in the itinerary paragraphs, then they will be asked at this point
(one-by-one). For each question, you will have to type in an answer to display when this file is
selected, the text to be entered in the itinerary, and the tour description on tour orders for this answer.
The tour description can either replace or add to the current tour description (defaults to add-to).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>After all of these questions have been answered, the screen displays all of the questions. If you want
to add another question (maybe an option isn't described in the itinerary) then you can select the next
number, and the system will ask for the question and answer information.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>NOTE: Paragraph that aren't associated with tours are also entered here. For example, the tour
features paragraph is entered as FEATURES.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Remember: Special codes can be typed into the tour description. (ie., Airport transfer to [!hotel])

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>NOTE: The description for SIC and PMC tours can be entered in this screen. (Otherwise the desc will
read...Desc (SIC))

<p>The second screen contains the replacements for alternate itinerary descriptions and alternate tour
descriptions. If alternate tour descriptions should be printed on the voucher, enter each description
under Tour desc 1 and tour desc 2. If you want to add the description to the current description, enter
a code or "A," otherwise enter "R" to replace the description on the tour order. For example, a tour
is supplied in the morning or afternoon. You could enter -morning on the first and -afternoon on the
second with a code of "A." When the tour description is set on the tour order, it will read "Sightseeing
-morning."
