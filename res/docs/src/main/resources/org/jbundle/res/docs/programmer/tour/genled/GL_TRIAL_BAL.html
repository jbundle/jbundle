<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Trial Balance Print-out simply prints the balances of selected accounts as of a specified date.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>You will be asked to enter the cut-off date of the report and the profit center if applicable. (The
cut-off date should be a period ending date)

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The report is fairly simple. The accounts are printed in order and their balances as of the cut-off-date
are printed under the heading of Debit or Credit. If the balance for an account is not typical, then an
asterisk prints next to the amount.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If an account has the subtotal flag set to Yes, then a sub-total is printed on the Trial Balance if you
select sub-totals.
