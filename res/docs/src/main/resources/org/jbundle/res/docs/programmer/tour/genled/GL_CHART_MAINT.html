<p>The fields are used as follows:

<p>-	Typical balance. "D" for debit; "C" for credit. These accounts will be flagged when the
amount is not typical.

<p>-	Section sub-total. A sub-total will print on the Trial balance and worksheet

<p>-	Counter balance account. If an account number is entered here, you can automatically have
an entry for this amount when a journal entry is made. (For example: Depreciation/Depr.
expense)

<p>-	G/L Auto-distribution code. When a transaction is made to this account, you have the option
of distributing this amount to the accounts set up in the Auto-distribution file.

<p>-	Y-T-D file compression. When the year-end program is run, directs the system how to take
care of the previous year's transactions: "N" - no compression;  "P" - Compress all transaction
for each period; "Y" - Compress all transactions for the year.

<p>-	Discontinued on. If an account is no longer used, it should be discontinued until the year-end,
so the current transaction have an account.
