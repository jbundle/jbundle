<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This program can be used as a pre-G/L posting review, or a G/L transaction source detail after
posting.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>First, enter the transaction type:

<p>	"I" will print issued ticket transactions

<p>	"D" will print departed ticket transactions

<p>	"O" will print ticket override transactions

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Next, enter the date range to print.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>To print only transaction posted to the General Ledger, answer "Y"; To print only transactions NOT
posted to the G/L type "N"; otherwise press return and all transactions will print.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>To print the booking description of each transaction, answer Yes to the last question.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The report prints the debit, credit and variance amounts for each transaction. If the variance is positive,
it will be a debit; negatives are credits.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>NOTE:	Since this program is not run often, it has to do an inefficient sequential search throuh
the Ticket detail. This program can take a long time to run.
