<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Type in the reference number of the currency to change. In this program, only the exchange rate may
be changed. If you enter zero as the exchange rate, you will be asked for the indirect exchange rate
and the exchange rate will be calculated.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>NOTE: When you change the exchange rate in this program, the last exchange rate is also updated
to the same rate. If this is not desired, use currency maintenance to adjust the rates.
