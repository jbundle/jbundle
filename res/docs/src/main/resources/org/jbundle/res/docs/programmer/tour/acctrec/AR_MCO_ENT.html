<p>Program Description:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This program is used to enter all incoming MCOs for tours (both deposits and final payments).

<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Usually this program is easy to operate because the payment is usually returned with the confirmation
payment stub. The stub has the booking number printed on it, making receipt entry very simple.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>You can either enter the booking number if you know it, or you can enter the agency's ARC number
and all unpaid bookings will display. Select the correct booking from this display to continue.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>For each MCO received, you have to enter the MCO number, carrier code, Net MCO amount,
Commission percentage or amount, Tax box, and the service charge percentage or amount. The net
amount will display automatically.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Next, you will be asked for the Amount to apply to this booking. The amount defaults to the Net
MCO amount, but this amount does not have to be the same.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This program is also used to do changes and deletions. If a MCO is found from the same agency with
the same booking number, then the system will ask if you want to change the old one or enter a new
one.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If there are more than one cash accounts for receivables, then you also have to enter this.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The A/R account that is entered defaults to the one that is listed in the booking's tour header.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The MCO calculations are done as follows:

<p>	NET = GROSS - COMMISSION - TAXES - SERVICE CHARGE

<p>	COMMISSION = GROSS * COMM%

<p>	TAXES = GROSS * TAX%

<p>	SVC CHG = GROSS * SVC%
