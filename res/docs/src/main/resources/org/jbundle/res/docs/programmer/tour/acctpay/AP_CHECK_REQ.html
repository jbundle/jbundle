<p>Program Description:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This program allows you to request checks to be printed by the automatic check printing program. For
each vendor, you can either request a check for the currently selected invoices or you can enter a
prepayment.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>On the next run of the check printing program, all of the requested checks will be printed.

<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If you have more than one bank account, then the system will ask for the bank account to enter checks
for. All of the currently requested checks will display on the screen. The system will ask for the next
vendor to select.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>To enter a check request, just enter the vendor code of the vendor that you want to pay. The system
will ask you to enter the amount of the check (defaults to current selection). If the amount is different
then the vendor selection at check printing, then the system will create a pre-payment for the vendor.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>To de-request a payment, just change a vendor line, then hit return.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This program is also used to select the payment to a broker for drafts entered in the broker payment
module.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>To see the resulting G/L entries, take a look at the check printing program. This program has no effect
on any balances. Check printing is where the data is updated.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	NOTE: Vendors may be entered in any order and a vendor may be paid more than once on a check run.
When the lines are displayed, they will be displayed in order by vendor code. It is useful to re-display
a long check request to catch a possible double entry to a vendor.
