<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Enter a number (such as 10, 20, etc) and the description of the statement (ie., Balance Sheet). Then
enter the statement format code. "C" is a three column format; "R" has a single column and a ratio.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The statements might contain an Income Statement, Statement of Retained Earnings, and a Balance
Sheet. Or it might only contain a Statement of Changes in Financial Position.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Note: It is a good idea to number your statements by tens. Then if a supporting statement has to be
added, you only have to add statement number 5 and 7 for example.
