<p>Program Description:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This program is used to enter foreign currency draft(s) purchased from a currency broker or a bank.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The system needs to know who each draft is payable to, the amount, and which invoices the draft
covers. It also needs to know the exchange rates on each draft, and the total U.S. dollar amount so a
check can be printed for the broker.

<p>/SCREEN1/

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The first information to enter is the vendor code of the broker you are purchasing the draft from
(defaults to most vendor in to control file).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Then, if drafts have already been entered, then they will display on the screen.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>For each draft that you are going to purchase, you have to enter the vendor code of the payee, and
the amount of the draft (The amount defaults to the current selected amount). If the amount is
different than the amount selected, it will be set up as a pre-payment.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The system will ask for either the U.S. Dollar amount of the purchase, or you can enter the exchange
rate and the system will calculate the U.S. dollar amount for you.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If you want to enter more than one draft purchase, enter the first batch, then request a check. When
you enter this program again, the selected broker purchase will not display.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>After all of the amounts have been entered, you should request either a manual or automatic check
request.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If auto-update is selected in the control file, then the current exchange rate in the currency file will be
updated when the check for the broker is printed.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Note:	If you don't know the distribution of a broker payment, then you can enter a prepayment and
distribute it to the broker selection later (see prepayment request entry).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If the broker charges a service change on the exchange, enter an invoice amount for the service
change. The service charge will automatically be selected for payment along with the broker amounts.
Do not enter the service charge in this program. To see the total check amount, use vendor payment
selection.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The G/L entry isn't made until the check is printed.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>To see the resulting G/L entries, take a look at the check printing program. This program has no effect
on any balances. The check printing program updates the vendor A/P balances.
