<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>First, enter the account number, and a beginning and ending date (defaults to current period). Then
answer Yes if you want to see the beginning balance for the account.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Then the system will display the activity in this account during that period.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Note: If you want to see the beginning balance for an account, the system must read through all the
transactions before that date to calculate the amount. This may result in a delay in the display.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If you don't display the starting balance, the ending balance is the change for the transactions
displayed.
