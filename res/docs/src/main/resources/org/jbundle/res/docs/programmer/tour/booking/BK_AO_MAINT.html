<p>Program Description:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This file is used by the booking system to select the proper pricing, and products.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>When the a tour code and date are entered in the booking system, this file is accessed first. Depending
on what this file has in it, the correct pricing, hotels, land, air, and remarks are set for the booking.

<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>When designing a the optional information,always remember the following: the questions are evaluated
in order by seq. no.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The question sequence is the order the questions are evaluated, so if a question modifies another
question, make sure the order is correct. (ie., For a hotel upgrade, the upgrade question should be
sequenced after the question that set the original hotel)

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>First the Tour code and current question sequence along with all of the answers will display.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The system will ask if you want to change any of the answers. Your answer sequences should start
with 1.  You can enter an answer by entering it in an empty slot. The date range defaults to the header
starting and ending dates.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The first variable, "Ask Answer?" sets this question for auto or manual evaluation. (ie., For seasonal
Rates, you would have answers of "High," "Low," and "Shoulder." You wouldn't want the system to
ask the user for the season, as it can be evaluated from the departure date. You would answer "No"
to "Ask Answer?"

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The next variable, "Always Resolve?" pertains only to "Question/Answer" formats. (If the previous
variable was "N" this is always "Y."; Using the previous example, the system ALWAYS has to
evaluate the season) If you have an Answer that HAS to be answered, Answer "Yes." The system will
individually display the question and the user is forced to give an answer (none of the above is a valid
answer.) (For example, if the reservation agent should always ask if Tour Insurance is required,
answer "Yes.") All the questions with a "No" will be displayed in a galley for the res agent to review.
The user can select a particular question which will display withall the answers, or the user can skip
all the questions.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The record can be further modified by the following answer parameters:	Select by date (Always
select if in date range)

<p>			Use another Answers detail (If an Answers sequence number is entered here,
ALL of the Answer's information will be added to the booking (this is useful
for non-contiguous date ranges)

<p>			Select by day-of-week (Select if departure is Mon(1)-Sun(7) (NOTE: "123"
Means for Mon,Tue,Wed departures)

<p>			Select by gateway (If answer matches the air gateway, then the information
will be included)

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>For example, if you want to use hotel A for Jan-Jul and hotel B for Aug-Sep, all you have to do is:
Enter the seq. #1, question: Which hotel; Answer 1: Hotel A with the date range Jan-Jul; Answer 2:
Hotel B with this hotel's date range. Then go to the hotel screen and select Ques 1, answer 1 and enter
hotel A. Under ques 1 answer 2 enter Hotel B. (When the booking is made, the system won't ask any
questions, the hotel will automatically be selected depending on the tour departure date)

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>For another example, if you had an air-surcharge for December, you would Enter Question #2:
December Air surcharge, Answer 1 would be Air Surcharge, Dec 01-Dec 31. This would be the only
answer for this question. If the booking date were Dec 01-31, then the surcharge (entered in pricing)
and modified ticket (entered in ticket entry) would automatically be added to the booking.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Or maybe you want to give the client the chance to upgrade the hotel in Tokyo. Enter ques #1:
Upgrade to Palace hotel?, Answer #1: Yes.  (Answer #0 would be No). (You could also enter date
ranges if it was only available for a certain amount of time) Then you would go to hotel display for
Ques 1, answer 1(Yes) and delete the normal hotel (soft delete) and re-enter the upgraded hotel. Then
you would go to tour pricing and add an item, "Hotel upgrade surcharge" with the surcharge amount.
You don't have to make any changes to Alt 1, answer 0, because it is already correct.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The header field: Ask Answer and Always Resolve have to do with the way the question is processed.
If Ask Answer is No, then the question is resolved automatically (ie., Sunday surcharge). If it is Yes,
then the user must select the answer for the information to be added to the booking.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	NOTE: If an answer is entered with a sequence number of 0, the system does not process the detail
information (ie., no modifications may be made to a question with a zero sequence question) This is
useful in entering the default question to many answers. For example, if you were to ask: "Hotel
upgrade?"; answer 0 would be "No."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	NOTE: The guideline to use when deciding which items fall under one question is simple: A question can
resolve to only ONE answer (Remember: None of the above is a valid answer). Therefor if there is
a possibility of more than one answer, use another question.
