<p>Program Description:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This program is used to reconcile the amounts estimated as air overrides with the amounts actually
paid by a carrier.

<p>/SCREEN1/

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Enter the carrier code and the starting and ending TICKET departure date to process overrides
receipts for (The same dates entered when the submission report was run). Then enter the temporary
cash summary account and the date the override payment was received.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>All the tickets in the range for the carrier selected will default in departure date order.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Either press return to select the ticket number displayed, or enter a ticket number to enter the amount
received for. For each ticket, enter the amount of override received. The amount defaults to the
amount submitted to the carrier.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>You may change a receipt by entering the ticket number and re-entering the amount. The amount can't
be changed after is has been posted to the General Ledger.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If you have entered a amount which actually wasn't received, you can clear the amount by typing DEL
at the CHANGE ITEM prompt. This doesn't delete the ticket, it only clears the override received
amount.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The next time the G/L posting program is run, the overrides will be posted to the General Ledger. For
example:

<p>11/17/90	Override Summary Account		55.50

<p>		Gain/Loss on Overrides recvd	11.50

<p>			Overrides Receivable			67.00

<p>If is therefore important that the check received from the carrier is distributed to the override summary
account:

<p>11/17/90	Cash						55.50

<p>			Override Summary Account			55.50
