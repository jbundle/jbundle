<p>Program Description:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This program is used for entering credit memos into the A/R open item file. A credit memo is treated
exactly like a payment in the A/R system; It reduces the amount owed by the customer.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>For example, the customer did some marketing for you and instead of being reimbursed, you could
credit the amount to a booking.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Enter the booking number that you want to adjust. The booking information and the current A/R
transactions will display.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Enter the Credit Amount, date (defaults to today), G/L number, and the reference. The G/L number
is the account which isDebited.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The transaction is displayed as it will be posted. You can okay or cancel it at this time.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>All of the credits entered will be posted to G/L after entering the transactions.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Note:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Sample G/L entry:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>1/12/87 Marketing Expense   120.00

<p>          Accounts Receivable   tours    120.00

<p>            (Marketing done by agent)

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Note: Most credits will be created by the invoice printing program. When a tour price is modified
down, a credit is created.
