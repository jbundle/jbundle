<p>Program Description:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This program is used to enter invoices amounts received from vendors.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Program Explanation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>When invoices (or statements if no invoices are sent) are recieved for services provided by vendors,
the amount owed for a service becomes certain. This is the amount which the vendor expects to
receive.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This program allows you to enter invoices as they come in. In most cases there will be a departure
estimate to check against the vendor's invoice.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The system will also take invoices that do not have a departure estimate (A UPS bill for instance).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>All of the invoices entered are automatically selected for payment, so paying all of the items on the
vendor's month-end statement will be a  breeze. (See payment selection)

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Sometimes the amount estimated at departure is different from the invoice amount (Changes in
itinerary, etc). In these cases, a gain or loss will be recognized.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>When you enter this program, you have two choices. You can enter the vendor number and enter all
of the invoices for that vendor, or you can enter the reference number of the departure estimate which
corresponds to the invoice. The second method is easier only when the invoices are returned with your
voucher numbers. The vouchers have the reference numbers printed on them.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If you don't enter the vendor number under item #1, then you can enter the entry number of the
finalization estimate under #6.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If you do enter the vendor number under number 1, then the computer will automatically display all
departure estimates that have been made and you will be given a chance to enter the invoice amount
for all of them.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If you want to enter an invoice that isn't on the screen,

<p>then press return at "SELECT" and "DISPLAY NEXT PAGE" and enter the tour number. If this is
for a tour, the system will ask for the services description and the dates.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>To enter an invoice for a non-tour related item, enter a tour number of 0, then enter a cost and A/P
G/L number. The Cost G/L defaults to the G/L account in the vendor file. The A/P G/L default the
the non-tour G/L in the A/P control file.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The invoice amount defaults to the departure estimate and the General Ledger numbers automatically
display from the numbers entered in the voucher detail. For non-tour invoices, the G/L cost account
is entered on the screen.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>After entering the invoice, you have a chance to change it at the CHANGE ITEM prompt. To delete
an invoice, type DEL. You cannot delete invoices which have been posted to G/L.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>After entering this invoice the cursor returns to the field where this invoice was started.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>To return to the A/P menu, hit return until the cursor is on the Entry prompt. Hit return one more time
to end.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Note: This system should be used to enter all costs directly related to a tour. Tour director checks should be
entered here, then a check should be requested, rather than entering the check in Asset/Debt
maintenance.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Vendor entries should be made for Tour Conductors and independent contractors, so a 1099 can be
produced at the end of the year.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Over/Under estimate is a gain or loss due to changes in the cost of services, not exchange rates,
so it is based on the exchange rate on the departure estimate date.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Usually the Over/Under estimate is posted in the current period because the amount is not be known
for some time after the departure date and the amount is usually not material. If you want to match
the cost of over/under estimates and gains/losses on currency changes to the correct period, then wait
a few months for all the payments to be made and run the Tour Cost Analysis Report. This will give
you the adjusting entry for the general ledger (don't forget the reversing entry).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Note: If you try deleting an invoice and you get a warning that it has already been posted to G/L the
only way to clear the invoice is to enter zero for the amount, select the amount and include it in a
payment or prepayment distribution. If a departure estimate was set up already, you might do a manual
G/L entry to correct the cost classification. (ie., Debit Over/Under, Credit the cost account)
