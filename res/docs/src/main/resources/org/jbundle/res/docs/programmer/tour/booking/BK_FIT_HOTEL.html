<p>Program Description:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This program is used to display a hotel's prices and/or enter the hotel info needed for FIT building.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>/SCREEN1/

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The program operation depends on what information is passed in:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If the hotel is not passed in, then the hotel code is entered, the file is read, and the standard hotel
information is displayed.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If the date has no been passed in, then it is entered. The date is used to look up the correct hotel rate.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Then, if a rate type is passed in (indicating the detail is costed), then the current costs and selections
are displayed. After the display, you can change any fields at the "ANY CHANGE" prompt.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If the current rate type is blank (indicating that this has never been costed [ie., scheduled, unsch, or
mod], or there is no rate), then the prices have to be checked.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>-	If a default rate type doesn't exist, then the user is prompted for the rate type, otherwise the
rate type is set to the current rate type and the rate type is displayed.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>-	Next, the pricing file is checked for the existence of this rate.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>-	If the pricing exists, then they are displayed and the "Any Change" prompt appears.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>-	If the pricing doesn't exist, then the prior year's rates are checked.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>-	If the prior year's rates exist, then the rates will be displayed and you will be asked, "Use prior
year's rate as basis?"

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>-	If you answer "Y"es, then you will enter a markup % which will immediately mark up the
rates.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>-	If the prior year's rates don't exist, or you answer "N"o to the Markup question, then you will
be asked if you want to enter a manual rate. If you enter manual rates, the system will prompt
you for each of the hotel room rates.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Once the correct hotel price is displayed, all the available meals are displayed. You will be prompted
to enter a meal code. (Up to four meal codes may be entered per hotel)

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>After the meal is entered, the number of meals are entered, which defaults to the number of days. 
Then you must enter the days to supply the meals. (ie., D  - 4 - 1234 means that you want a dinner
on the evening of check-in and for the next three nights [defaults to 2345])

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If a meal doesn't exist, the system will ask if you want to enter a manual meal cost. Enter the cost in
the local currency rounded to the nearest nteger.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>After entering the meal, the first five services offered by this vendor are displayed. For a hotel, this
may be transfers, open bar, etc. (ie., BKKPROPENB)
