<p>This program is used to select Alternates and Optionals.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>First, this program displays each of the Alternate questions, one by one with all of the answers
displayed. The user must choose an answer for each one, or default to answer 1.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Next, a list of all of the Optional questions are displayed. If the user selects a question, then all answers
are displayed and the user selects the same as above.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>After answering an optional answer, the screen re-displays all optional questions starting with the next
one after the one answered.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This program updates the ALT/OPT matrix in the booking screen.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>NOTE:	This program is used ONLY to add to the ALT/OPT matrix. Any changes must be
made through the BK_ALT_OPT program.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This module is a special program used to display, select and de-select alternates and options. It uses
the save screen option and uses only the bottom part of the screen. The bottom will be restored
afterwards, and the new information will be displayed on the original screen.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>NEEDED!

<p>Should have an option of displaying the detail for each option (ie., cost, hotels, etc...) The agent will
probally be asked, how much extra for this option, or what hotel will I get with the hotel upgrade.
