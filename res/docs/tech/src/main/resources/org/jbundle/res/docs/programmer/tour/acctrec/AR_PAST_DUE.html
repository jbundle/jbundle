<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>First enter the "Past due as of" date (defaults to todays date). If a payment is past due at this date, then
it will be included on the report.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The next two questions ask if you want to check the deposit and/or final payment dates. Both of the
answers default to yes. The MCO margin keeps deposits which are within the entered percentage from
printing on the report (MCO deposits often are written as commissionable).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The last two questions ask if you want to print the report and the notices. The report is used to call
the agents about past due amounts. Answering yes to notice printing will print past due notices to be
mailed out.
