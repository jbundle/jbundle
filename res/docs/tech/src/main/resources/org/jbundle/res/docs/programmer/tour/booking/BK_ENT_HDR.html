<p>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This program is the initial program in the booking entry process.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>After opening the files, this program asks the user for a booking number.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If the user hits return, the menu screen is displayed. A new booking is not initiated until either agency,
passenger, or tour information are entered.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If the user types a booking number, then the booking is read and the appropriate menu is displayed.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>After the booking is complete, the system checks to see if all of the information for a complete
booking is entered.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If this is a modification of a current booking, then the system first checks to see that all the information
is still complete. If it is not, the user will get a warning, and be returned to the booking menu. Only
a cancelled booking can be incomplete.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If the booking is a modification, then the system reads the original to see if there were any changes.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>For new bookings:

<p>If all the information is entered, then:

<p>	The system asks if the user wants to make a booking.

<p>		If not, then all of the booking information is cleared. 			(For FITs,
the system continues to the next Q) 		If yes, then the ALT/OPT file is scanned to create 		the booking line-items. In the date range, Alternate 		0 and any selected records
will be read. Then the 		corresponding pricing records will be read from the 		tour pricing file and written to the booking line-item 		detail file. The remaining manual
line-items will be 		added to the total and the booking totals will be 		calculated.

<p>If all the information is not entered, then:

<p>	The system asks if the user wants to disregard the information. If not, then the user will return
to the booking menu to finish the booking.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Then the program continues so the user can enter the next booking.
