<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This document will automatically be sent to the client's agent when the first payment is due. For
example, for an FIT, this document would be sent when the clients accept the tour. If payment is not
required until the services are confirmed, then a document is sent (See document maint) on the
booking date, and the confirmation/invoice is sent when (and if) the services are confirmed.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If the final payment is required in advance, then the user will first enter the booking, then enter the
payment, then print the confirmation. The confirmation will automatically show any payments made.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The way this operates is as follows:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>For FITs where the acceptance is required, the initial booking and tour status is NS (proposal stage).
If the client accepts the proposal, then you go to booking entry and change the BOOKING status to
OK and the TOUR status to HK (awaiting confirmation). When all of the services are confirmed, the
system will automatically change the status to OK.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>For tours where the invoice is sent immediately after booking (ie., TRVL B) the initial BOOKING
status is OK and the initial TOUR status is OK. When the services are requested (same day) the tour
status is changed to HK until all the services have been acknowledged.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>For tours where the invoice is sent only after the services are confirmed (Travel Bargains?) the initial
TOUR and BOOKING status are HK. When the services are confirmed, the TOUR status changes
to OK and the BOOKING status changes automatically to OK (Which causes an invoice to print)
