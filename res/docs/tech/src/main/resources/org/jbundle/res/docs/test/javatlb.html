<h3>What is the Java Type Library Wizard?</h3>
<p>The Java Type Library Wizard is a tool that reads type libraries
from .TLB, .OLB, .OCX, .DLL, and .EXE files and creates Java class files
with information about the COM interfaces and methods. These class files
are needed for both compiling and running a Java project using COM
components.</p>

<h3>Using the Java Type Library Wizard</h3>
<p>To create a Java description of COM components:</p>
<ol>
	<li>From the Tools menu in Microsoft<sup>&reg;</sup> Developer
	Studio, choose Java Type Library Wizard.<br>
	The Java Type Library Wizard dialog box appears.</li>
	<li>From the list, select the COM component(s) you want, check the
	box to the left of the name.<br>
	For this sample, select <b>Microsoft DAO 3.0 Object Library</b>.</li>
	<li>Click OK.<br>
	The Java Type Library Wizard processes the selected type libraries and
	creates Java descriptions of the selected COM components.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Output from the Java Type Library Wizard</h3>

After you have created Java descriptions of COM components, the output
window shows two useful types of information, the <b>import</b>
statement adn the SUMMARY.TXT file notice.

<h4>The <b>import</b> statement</h4>
<p>After the Java Type Library Wizard is finished, the output window
displays a Java <b>import</b> statement. In this sample:</p>
<pre>   import dao3032.*;</pre>
<p>Typically, you copy this line of text and insert it into the
beginning of any Java source file that uses the COM component. This has
been done for you in this sample; see line 11 in <b>simpledao.java</b>.
</p>
<p></p>
<h4>The <b>SUMMARY.TXT</b> line</h4>
<p>Following the <b>import</b> statement, the output window has
lines saying that the file SUMMARY.TXT has been created. This file lists
the interfaces and classes in the Java description of the type library.
Use this file to check the types for the parameters and return values in
the methods.</p>
<p>You will note that there are no methods listed for any of the
classes. Recall when calling COM from Java, you will use the <b>class</b>
file to create the COM component, but you must use the <b>interface</b>
file to access the COM component.</p>
<p>Double-click the SUMMARY.TXT line to view that file in Developer
Studio.</p>
