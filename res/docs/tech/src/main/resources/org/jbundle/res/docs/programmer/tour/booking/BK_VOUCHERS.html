<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Usually tour vouchers are processed automatically by the finalization system. This program is used to
manually process tour vouchers.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>First, the system will ask you for a tour number to process (defaults to the tour for the current
booking).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If the tour hasn't been finalized yet (or it needs re-finalization) you will be asked if you want to update
the voucher status. If you answer A, Y, or All, the hotel and land detail will be scanned to see if it is
current (Answering H or L will only update the land or hotel detail, respectively). If any vouchers need
updating, their status will be updated to request (or cancel) a voucher. The new voucher status' will
automatically display. After updating, you will be given a change to change the voucher status at the
"CHANGE ITEM" prompt. You can Reprint, Hold, or mark a voucher as printed at this point.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Note: If you are operating the tour for the current booking and you have changed any of the detail, you will
be asked to finish the booking (Answer Yes to Changes OK?) before processing the tour.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Next, you will be asked if you want to process any tour documents. Hit return to finish, or enter a
valid document type to continue. Valid types are:

<p>	H - Hotel Tour Orders

<p>	V - Hotel Vouchers

<p>	L - Land Tour Orders

<p>	W - Land Vouchers

<p>	P - Alpha Tour Passenger List

<p>	O - Tour rooming list

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The document type determines what vouchers will print, their format, and whether or not the print
status is to be updated. If you select H for hotels or L for land, only the vouchers with a "print" status
will be printed. If you select any other format, ALL the hotel or land vouchers will print and the status
codes will no update.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Next, enter the document format file and the form to print the document on. Type "T" to send the
document to the Telex "Form."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Remember, if you don't update the voucher's status, the vouchers will be printed for the CURRENT
voucher detail, rather than the actual tour detail.
