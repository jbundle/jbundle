<p>Program Description:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This program sets up the A/P departure or finalization estimates for a tour.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Basically, this program scans the current hotel detail and creates a voucher for each hotel. If vouchers
have already been sent, this program scans the current detail, compares it to the old detail and adjusts
vouchers to be re-sent or cancelled.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This program is run when the A/P detail has to be set up. Either automatically in finalization
processing, or manually in voucher set-up.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>First, this program reads through the current hotel detail for ALL the bookings for this tour. Passenger
hotel modifications are also scanned.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>For each hotel voucher, a finalization or departure estimate is set up. The USD equivalent amount for
departure estimates is calculated using the last exchange rate, rather then the costing exchange rate,
sometimes creating a difference between the costing and the voucher totals.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Note:	Remember, vouchers are NOT built for maual hotels, or hotels which already have manual
estimates entered for them.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>NOTE:	Currently, passenger modifications are not processed because the costing program will
not process them.
