<p>Program Description:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>When a payment has to be made before the services are rendered, a prepayment request is entered.
Later, after the services have been rendered, the prepayment is distributed to invoices until the balance
reaches zero.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>There are two type of prepayments. One which is for specific future services and one which is general.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>To enter a new prepayment request, type 0; otherwise enter the prepaymant request that you wish to
modify.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This is a very simple program. To enter a prepayment, just enter the vendor code and the amount of
the prepayment. If the prepayment is for a specific tour, then enter the tour number.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Enter the starting service date if you know it, otherwise enter a space to select no date. The list on the
check stub is in order by starting service date.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If you want, you can enter a description of the prepayment. This will appear on the check. The
description defaults to "Prepayment for tour XXX departing on XX-XX-XX.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>After entering each prepayment request, the system will automatically select this prepayment request
for payment.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If you enter a check request, then the next check run will contain a check to the specified vendor for
the amount of the prepayment.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Note: This program is also used to change and delete current prepayment requests. Just type in the entry
number of the prepayment request and the information will display. Once the prepayment request has
been paid, then it can't be changed.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This whole sub-system can be overridden by going to the check request program, entering an amount,
and running the check printing program. Any balance unselected will be distributed to a prepayment.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The booking system will automatically transfer information on prepayment requests to the A/P system
to be reviewed and paid. This is a major source of prepayments requests.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Prepayment requests that haven't been paid can be deleted from the system at any time with no
consequences to any other system. Nothing is updated until the check is printed!

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>To see the resulting G/L entries, take a look at the check printing program. Prepayment requests aren't
posted until they are paid.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In the inquiry and report programs, a prepayment request will display, but the balance will be zero
until a check is printed (then the balance will be a credit for the prepayment amount).
