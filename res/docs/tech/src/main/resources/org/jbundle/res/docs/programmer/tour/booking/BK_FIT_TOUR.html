<p>Program Description:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This program is used to display a land product's prices and/or enter the land info needed for FIT
building.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The program operation depends on what information is passed in:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If the land code is not passed in, then the land code is entered, the file is read, and the land
information is displayed.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If the date has not been passed in, then the date is entered. The date is used to read the correct land
rate.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Next, the rates are checked to see if they exist. The Seat-in-Coach rate and the Private
Car/MotorCoach rates are displayed.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If only one rate or the other are available, the system automatically chooses the correct rate-type and
displays it.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If there is a rate for both SIC and PMC, then the two rates are displayed for the current number of
passengers and the range of PMC prices are displayed. You are asked to enter the SIC cutoff (The
number of passengers it will take to make this tour go with PC/PMC). The default cutoff is at the point
where the price differential reverses. Entering zero will force you to answer the PMC/SIC question
and you will have to make a new selection at each re-costing. Entering one will always select SIC.
Entering 999 will always select PMC.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>NOTE: If one rate or the other aren't available then the cutoff will be set to 1 or 999 to always select
the same type. If the prices were marked up from a previous year or entered manually, the cutoff will
be set to -1. (You will still answer the SIC/PMC question, so the tour order will be correct).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If both the rates aren't found, then the system will check to see if the prior year's rates are available.
If either rate is found, it is displayed and you are asked if you want to use last year's rates and mark
them up. If you use last year's rates, you will have to enter the markup percentage, and then select the
rate type if both rates are available.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Next, if any itinerary questions exist, then the question and all the possible answers are displayed. You
must select an answer which is appropriate.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The answer test for each question will automatically display.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>After all the selections have been made, the correct tour-order description is displayed.
