<p>Program Description:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This program is used to post the Accounts Receivable Transactions to the General Ledger.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>WARNING: This program requires exclusive use of the A/R files. This means that while this program
is running, no one can use the booking or A/R system.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Enter the cut-off date of the A/R transactions to post. All transactions with a posting date before or
on this date will be consolidated into one transaction and posted to the General Ledger.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If you answer yes to the second question, Re-read all G/L information, The G/L numbers will be re-read from the tour headers before posting. You wont have to do this, unless a tour header contained
the wrong G/L information and was corrected after bookings were made. If you answer Yes to this
question, you can be sure all the current tour G/L information will be used, but this program will run
considerably slower because for each transaction, the booking, and then the tour header must be read.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Before you run this program, it is important that the range of dates to be posted all fall within the
accounting periods specified in the G/L accounting period file.

<p>The following is a review of all the possible transactions to be posted from the A/R system, and where
the A/R account number is read for each transaction.

<p>			Inc acct	Income account (dr/cr entry)

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Note: Refunds are not posted until the checks are cut. This is done because the pending refunds are usually
not material and the amount is accuratly reflected in a smaller A/R amount. If this adjustment is
required, check the pending refunds in A/R refund review and enter a manual G/L entry (remember
to reverse the transaction in the next period).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Note: If any of the tour header accounts aren't entered in the tour's header, then the default account in the A/R
control file will be used.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Note: Any transactions entered after the departure date are handled exactly as in these examples, with the
following exception:

<p>Any adjustment to the tour price is balanced with a departure date adjustment. Since the departure
date has already passed, the entry is done in the period of the departure date. This adjusts the prior
period's amounts to the correct values.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Note: All the account numbers are supplied at the point of entry, so it is important that the tour headers and
the control file information are accurate.
