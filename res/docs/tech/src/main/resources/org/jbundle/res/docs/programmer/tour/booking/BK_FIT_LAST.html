<p>Program Description:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This program is used to cost the current booking components.

<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>When this program is first entered, the current hotel, land/transportation, air, and other costs are
totaled. The costing process is done as follows:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>For each line item: if the cost already exists, it is added to the total cost. If the cost doesn't exist, then
new cost is looked up and added to the total cost. If the look-up doesn't produce a cost, a warning is
displayed and this program will not produce a costing.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If a price, exchange rate, etc. changes after the original costing, the new cost will NOT be calculated
automatically (The original cost will display). You will have to use the RE-COST function described
below.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Once the costing is complete, you are prompted to enter a markup percentage and agency commission
rate. The Rates will display based on these values.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>After entering the markup and commission, you can change any of the other values to arrive at a
selling price. Ground markup and commission and air markup and commission allow you to have
different air and ground rates. The field "Air net ta m/u" allows you to markup the air based on the
Net-to-Agent of the air ticket. The Net-to-Agent is the Air Fare minus the commission rate. (This
markup doesn't take into account the air override)

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The screen also allows you to change the departure date. All services will automatically be adjusted
to the new departure date and the costing will automatically be re-costed.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Number 9 on the screen allows you to cost the same itinerary based on different passenger counts.
Remember to enter accurate land SIC/PMC cutoff values for this to work properly.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Number 10 allows you to cost only the additional services added to a booking. To use this function,
you must first see the word "BASIS" display next to the P/P DOUBLE price when the basis cost is
displayed. (If basic isn't displayed, just re-cost to set the cost basis). Next, exit the costing module and
change the detail to the new information. When you return to this screen, BASIS will not display, and
the new cost will be calculated. Enter a markup percentage under number 10 and the system will
markup only the additional cost to give you the "ADD-ON" price.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The RE-COST function is used to Re-cost a booking from scratch. The exchange rates and costs are
re-read from the current files to come to the current cost. If a cost is not found, but was in the original
costing, the costing continues with the original cost. A warning will display to alert you to a possible
problem.
