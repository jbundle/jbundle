<p>Program Description:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This program is used to analyze costs for each tour.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This program takes a look at the history of each cost. It looks to see what the estimate, invoice, and
payment amounts were, so you can find out where the differences are.

<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>You can run this report for a range of Tour Codes and departure dates. You can also select certain
tour types to print (ie., FIT only).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If you want, you can see all of the detail on each cost. You also have the option of not printing sub-totals for each tour.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The last question allows you to run the report as if no transactions were entered after a certain date.
This would be useful if you wanted to run a report for year-end after the year-end.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Notes:	A similar program is available in the reporting system. The Tour Analysis Report also includes
the income for each tour, so you can see the profit made for each tour.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>		These are some of the answers that this report could answer:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>What was the cost of tours for a period?

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>How close were the estimates to actual invoice and payment amounts?

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>What was the over/under estimate for tours last year? (match F/S)

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>What was the gain/loss on curr changes for tours last year?

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>How much of the over/under in the F/S is attributable to tours departing in the fiscal year?

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>What percentage of the estimates were invoices at the F/S date?

<p>What percentage of the estimates were paid at the F/S date?

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>What percentage of the invoices are paid?
