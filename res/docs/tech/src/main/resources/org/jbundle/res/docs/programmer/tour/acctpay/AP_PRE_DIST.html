<p>Program Description:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This program allows you to distribute a prepayment to specific invoices. The prepayment balance can
be distributed until it reaches zero.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>/SCREEN1/

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>To start, enter the entry number of the prepayment to distribute.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Once the prepayment is selected, the current selection for this vendor will display. The selection must
be equal to or less than the prepayment amount. You don't have to distribute the whole amount. The
prepayment may be reduced in more than one distribution.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Notes:	This program is also used to distribute debit memos. Program operation is exactly the same.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>A G/L entry is generated for the items distributed to, for example:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>10/3/86  Cost of Tours - FIT   500.00

<p>         Gain/Loss on curr exch 10.00  (Loss)

<p>             Prepayments to Vendors     510.00

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Note: Usually, a zero prepayment or debit memo amount cannot be distributed to invoices, because
after distribution the internal status is changed to "fully distributed." There is an exception which is
allowed to distribute to invoices which are for a zero amount. In this case, a debit memo can be
created for a zero amount, and then distribtued to selected invoices with zero amounts. This provides
a way of clearing departure estimates for which an amount is never invioced.
