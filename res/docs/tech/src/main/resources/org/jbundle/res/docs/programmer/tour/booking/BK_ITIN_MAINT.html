<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The itinerary file maintenance program is a simple file maintenance program.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This information is added to the Land file, so the coding should be consistent with the land file coding:

<p> 	First 3 letters: City code

<p>	Next letter	: Type of land entry (I-Itinerary)

<p>	Next 2 letters	: Sequence to keep codes unique

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>For example, the code: HKGI1 might be a paragraph describing arrival into Hong Kong.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The itinerary description can take up to two full lines. The city code should be the ARC airport code,
or three letter abbreviation of the city if there is no airport.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The tour type must always be "I" for an Itinerary header.
