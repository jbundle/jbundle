<p>Program Description:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This program displays a day by day list of all the services for this booking/tour, including hotel, land,
transportations, air, and additional itinerary paragraphs.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>/SCREEN1/

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>When you first enter this screen, any previous services will display on the screen, leaving enough room
at the bottom to add at least two more services. After the display, the Any Change? prompt will
appear. To continue with the display, just hit return.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	NOTE: If this is a new booking, no services will display, the prompt will be positioned to enter the first
service. The day automatically defaults to the same day if the last entry was a hotel, otherwise it
defaults to the next day.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The reaction of the cursor to the Any Change? prompt depends if information is on the selected line.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>- If there is information on the selected line, then the cursor   moves to the day input position of the
line.

<p>  - The current day is the default

<p>  - Typing 0 or end or del will delete the line

<p>  - Typing a different day will cause the system to

<p>    ask "Adjust subsequent services?"

<p>- If there is no information on the selected line, then a day is reqd.   Note: After entering a new line,
the cursor prompts on the next line   rather then going back to the "Any change?" prompt.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>- Next, the service is entered (defaults to old/last city)   - Hit ESCape to display services, the system
will ask Hotel...etc.   - First the system checks for a matching FIT module.

<p>  - Then the system checks for a matching Hotel code.

<p>  - Then the system checks for a matching Land code.

<p>  - Then the system checks for a matching Transportation code.   - Then the system checks for a
matching Air code.

<p>  (If the code matches any of the files, then the appropriate    information/entry screen appears)

<p>  - If a match isn't found, then the system asks which type of service.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Then this screen will re-appear. To end detail entry, just hit return at the "Any Change?" prompt. (In
the middle of a service display, type end.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Next, the system will ask, "Recost Services?" Selecting yes will display the costing screen. You may
make changes to the markup, etc at this point. After hitting return, the system will take a few seconds
and re-cost the entire itinerary. The cost(s) will appear on the screen.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>----

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>When a service is found, the action depends on the service type:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>For hotels, the system checks to see if a rate exists for the tour's default rate/class.

<p>-	If the rate exists, the system will ask for the number of nights

<p>-	Typing 0 for the number of nights sends you to the cost scrn.

<p>-	If the rate doesn't exist, then the hotel name and default rate type are passed to the hotel
pricing display/entry program which will either get the information for the hotel, or return an
error which will clear the current line.
