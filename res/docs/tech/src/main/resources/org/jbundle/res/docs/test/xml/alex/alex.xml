    Alex,
  </paragraph>
  
  <paragraph>
    I'm answering your e-mail in three different formats to illustrate how you
	would deliver a document using XML and XSL.
  </paragraph>

  <paragraph>
    Actually, I only wrote this letter once. When I was ready to send it to you,
	I selected the output format using an XSLT stylesheet. I have two XSLT
	stylesheets. One to convert a letter to web format (html) and another to
	convert a letter to pdf.
  </paragraph>

  <paragraph>
    If you are interested here are the original documents:
	<list>
	  <item>
	    The original letter looks like this:
		  <link>
		    <name>Original letter to Alex in XML.</name>
			<url>http://www.donandann.com/docs/test/xml/alex/xml.xml</url>
		  </link>
	  </item>
	  <item>
	    The html stylesheet looks like this:
		  <link>
		    <name>XSLT stylesheet to create a web (html) document.</name>
			<url>http://www.donandann.com/docs/test/xml/alex/xmlhtml.xml</url>
		  </link>
	  </item>
	  <item>
	    The pdf stylesheet looks like this:
		  <link>
		    <name>XSLT stylesheet to create an adobe (XSL-FO or PDF) document.</name>
			<url>http://www.donandann.com/docs/test/xml/alex/xmlpdf.xml</url>
		  </link>
	  </item>
	</list>
  </paragraph>

  <paragraph>
    Back to your question.
  </paragraph>

  <paragraph>
    To send a itinerary or document in pdf from BCS or another system, you would
	do the following:
	<list>
	  <item>
	    First, tell your system to create the document in XML.
	  </item>
	  <item>
	    Next, tell your XSLT converter to convert the document to the format
		you want to send the document in (html, pdf, or whatever).
	  </item>
	  <item>
	    Last, send it to the customer or vendor. Generally, you would send it as
		an e-mail attachment or as a link to the document on your web server.
	  </item>
	</list>
  </paragraph>

  <paragraph>
    Many software companies have packages to do XSLT (Microsoft, Sun, IBM, etc.)
	Their capabilites and prices vary by vendor and capability.
  </paragraph>

  <paragraph>
    I prefer cocoon by apache. It's free and it does everything. The pdf
	converter is also free. No royalties, no licences, runs on any computer.
  </paragraph>

  <paragraph>
    XSL technology isn't a secret. The specification is available for free on the
	Web. Every technology company is pushing it. It is simple for programmers
	because document only has to created in a single format (XML) and the
	XSL stylesheet does to conversion to text, PDF, HTML, or whatever new
	format comes up.
  </paragraph>

  <paragraph>
    Hope this helps.
