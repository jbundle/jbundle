<p>Program Description:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This program allows you to record and properly distribute manually written checks. This program
works exactly the same as the check request program; The only difference is that you have to enter
the check number.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>On the next run of the check printing program, all of the checks entered here will optionally be
includeed on the check register (you can run a separate check register for manual checks if you want).

<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If you have more than one bank account, then the system will ask for the bank account to enter checks
for. All of the currently requested checks will display on the screen. The system will ask for the next
vendor to select.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>To enter a check request, just enter the vendor code of the vendor that you want to pay. The system
will ask you to enter the amount of the check (defaults to current selection). If the amount is different
then the vendor selection at check printing, then the system will create a pre-payment for the vendor.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Next, enter the check number of the check the vendor was paid with.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>To de-request a payment, just change a vendor line, then hit return.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This program is also used to select the payment to a broker for drafts entered in the broker payment
module.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>To see the resulting G/L entries, take a look at the check printing program. This program has no effect
on any balances. Check printing is where the data is updated.
