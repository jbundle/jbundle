<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>First, enter the statement number to edit. Then enter the first sequence to display, or press return to
start at the beginning.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Once the formats display, you can change the sequence numbers, the statement, or the account
numbers. You can also enter new lines that either reference or don't reference account numbers.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>For each line, you must enter:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The sequence number. This determines the ordering of this financial statement.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The statement number. You can switch an account to another statment by changing this field.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The G/L account number. This is not mandatory, you can leave this line blank and enter text to appear
on the financial statement.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Description. This field defaults to the description in the chart of accounts, but you may change
it to a description which is more appropiate for a financial statement.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Indent. Enter a number, up to three to determine the amount this description is indented.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Invisible. If this field is set to Yes, this field will not display. The amount will be added to the
subsequent field.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Paranthesis control. If the amount is not this sign, a parenthesis will be on the field.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Sub-total Level. Total all amount of this level or smaller. 9 is the highest sub-total level. (For example,
if you do a level 3 sub-total all amount up to the last level 3 subtotal will be aggregated and level 1,2,
and 3 subtotals will be reset). Remember that sub-totals span all the statements, so the income amount
can be moved to the retained earnings statement by using sub-totals.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Column. For multi-column formats, this field specifys the field to have the amount appear. (3 columns
maximum)

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Special. The special codes are as follows:

<p>UL -	Underline - All of the characters in this line will be underlined

<p>DU -	Double Underline - The text will be double - underlined

<p>LF -	Leave an empty line after this line

<p>PF -	New Page

<p>xx -	Replace with the total of statement number xx (For example, if the income statement is
statement 1, on the retained earnings statement, you would have a "Net Income" description
using code 1. You will usually follow this code with a subtotal which includes the preceeding
statement total.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Note: Since the format for valid accounts can be deleted from the format, it is a good idea to run the
statement formatting program to add back any accounts that may have been deleted.
