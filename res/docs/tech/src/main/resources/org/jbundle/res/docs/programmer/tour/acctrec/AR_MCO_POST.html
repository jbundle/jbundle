<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>To post to A/R, you must supply the system with the proper A/R account for the MCOs receivable
(Defaults to the account in the control file). This account is the amount of MCOs collected but not
yet received from the carriers.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The A/R account that is credited is the one that is listed in the MCO record.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>For example, the G/L entry for a batch of checks might be: 6/21/86  Accounts Receivable-MCOs
1432.00

<p>           Accounts Receivable - tours   1432.00

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If you make a mistake on an MCO and then post it, then you will have to run the submission report
for the erroneous MCO and then credit the A/R account (and the booking) in credit entry.
