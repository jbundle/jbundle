<p>Program Description:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This program is used to enter non-tour sales. For example, you may do some marketing for another
company. Here is where you enter the sale.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------

<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This is a fairly simple program. The system automatically assigns the next booking number to the
entry, then you enter the ARC number of the customer that you are selling to.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Next, enter the amount of the sale and the G/L account that the income should be credited to. The
debit is always to the Non-tour A/R account in the control maintenance screen.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>At the bottom of the screen you can enter as many comments as you like.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>When you are done entering all of the sales, the system will ask you if you want to post the entry to
G/L. If you do, then a sales report will be printed, a G/L entry will be created, and an A/R invoice
entry will be created, so the amount will show as being owed.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Cash receipts will automatically reverse the A/R entry because the tour number is zero.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------

<p>Notes:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The entry is handled just like a booking. The main difference is that an invoice doesn't print. The print
invoice flag is set to "X" on entry so that when the batch is over, the system can find the entries and
make the posting to G/L.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>A sample G/L posting is as follows:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>3/14/87 Other Income      763.00

<p>          Non-tour A/R        763.00

<p>            (Consulting done for XYZ company)

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The sales of fixed assets are handled through the Asset/Debt management system.
