<p>This program is used to display and change the passenger information.

<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If passengers have been entered before then the current passengers will display.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The passengers are entered line-by-line. First a Room Code is entered. 1 = Single, 2 = Double room,
3 = Triple room, 4 = Quad room. Then the passenger names are entered (First name first). If there
is more than one passenger, then the next passenger name is entered on the next line. Leaving the
passenger line blank will halt the passenger entry sequence.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>After all of the passengers are entered, the passengers count is set at the top of the screen.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Remember: For FIT and Modular type tours, the passenger counts can be overridden and entered in the tour
entry screen (for proposals). If the passenger count was overridden, the passengers counts will remain
unchanged, unless a change is made to the passenger detail.
