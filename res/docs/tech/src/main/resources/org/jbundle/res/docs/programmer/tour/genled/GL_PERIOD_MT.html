<p>Program Operation:

<p>First Time Entry:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The first time this module is entered, the computer will prompt the user for the starting date of the first
accounting period, otherwise the current accounting periods will display and you will have a chance
to change them.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Note: The accounting periods will automaticly change after the year-end program has been run;
therefore the periods will be changed very infrequently.
