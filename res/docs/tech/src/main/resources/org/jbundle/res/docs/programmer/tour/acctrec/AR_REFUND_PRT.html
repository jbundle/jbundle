<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>To run this program, just enter the bank account reference number of the account the refunds are
made. Then enter the starting check number.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>First, the Refund Journal will print. This is a summary of the checks that will be printed and to what
bookings they apply. Then the system will ask if it is okay to print the checks. All of the refund checks
will print automatically.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If the checks are alright, the A/R payment history will be updated, the check description will be posted
to A/M and the Open Item for the refund will be posted to G/L on the next posting date.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Notes:

<p>Refunds with pending MCOs will print once the MCO has been paid by the carrier.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If a refund was done manually, the refund should be entered as a debit memo. Describe the refund
on the A/R comment line.
