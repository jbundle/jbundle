<p>Program Operation:

<p>First, type in the tour number.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The system displays information on all the invoices, credit invoices, credit memos, prepayment
requests, departure estimates and finalization estimates for this tour.

<p>The amounts displayed for each item are as follows:

<p>For Invoices:				The invoice amount and balance.

<p>For Departure estimates:		The departure estimate for the amount and balance.

<p>For Finalization estimates:	The finalization estimate for the amount and a balance if the voucher
is confirmed or manual. (no USD)

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>After displaying the information, the system will ask you to select a voucher. It is asking which
voucher do you want to see the detail for. If you select a hotel voucher, the hotel and meal prices will
display. If you select a land voucher, the pricing for each land component will display.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Note: You cannot display the voucher detail for a manual voucher.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Note:	Remember that the costing exchange rate may be different than the departure estimate
exchange rate. The costing exchange rate is displayed in the hotel and land detail, and the
departure exchange rate is displayed after the booking mod.
