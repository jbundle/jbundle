<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This program can be used as a pre-G/L posting review, or a G/L transaction source detail after
posting.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Enter the date range to print.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>To print only transaction posted to the General Ledger, answer "Y"; To print only transactions NOT
posted to the G/L type "N"; otherwise press return and all transactions will print.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The report prints the debit and credit amounts for each transaction.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>NOTE:	Since this program is not run often, it has to do an inefficient sequential search throuh
the A/P detail. This program can take a long time to run.
