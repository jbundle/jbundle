<p>Program Explanation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This program is used for entering credit memos, debit memos, and refund requests into the A/R open
item file. A credit memo is treated exactly like a payment in the A/R system; It reduces the amount
owed by the customer. A debit memo is treated exactly like a charge in the A/R system; It increases
the amount owed by the customer. A refund request tells the A/R system to create a check on the next
refund check printing run.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>For example, the customer did some marketing for you and instead of being reimbursed, you could
credit the amount to a booking by entering a credit memo. If a customer bounced a check, a debit
memo would be entered.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Enter the booking number that you want to adjust. The booking information and the current A/R
transactions will display.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Enter the Transaction code (C=credit memo, D=Debit memo, and R=refund), the date (defaults to
today), G/L number, and the reference. The G/L number is the account which is Debited for Credits
and Credited for Debits. The counter account is always Accounts Receivable. As a default, the counter
account defaults to the Cost of Tours account.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The transaction is displayed as it will be posted. You can okay or cancel it at this time.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>All of the transactions entered will be posted to G/L after entering the transactions.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Sample G/L entries:

<p>1/12/87 Marketing Expense   120.00

<p>          Accounts Receivable - tours    120.00

<p>            (Credit booking; Marketing done by agent)

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>1/12/87 Accounts Receivable - tours   120.00

<p>          Cash - Trust account           120.00

<p>            (Debit booking; Bounced check)
