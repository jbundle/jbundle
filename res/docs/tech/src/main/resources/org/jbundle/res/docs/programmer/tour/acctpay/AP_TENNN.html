<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Enter a starting and ending vendor number, a starting and ending check date (usually the range for last
year) and whether you want the check detail to print.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The system will read thru the vendor file, stopping at each vendor with "Y" in the "Independent
Contractor" field. Then the payment history of every invoice for this vendor will be searched for
payments made in the entered range. The total, and optionally the detail, will print on the report.
