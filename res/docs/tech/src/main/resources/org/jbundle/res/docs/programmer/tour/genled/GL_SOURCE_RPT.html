<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This program prints an audit-trail of all transactions entered into the general ledger. The entries are
printed in cronological order within each source code. This organizes all the transactions by their
source (ie., AR, AP, PR, etc.).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The computer will ask  for a source code to print (defaults to all source codes). Then the computer
will ask for a beginning and ending date for transactions to be printed. Then you can enter a starting
and ending entry date (This may be useful when printing the auto-posting from the other systems).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The report will display all of the information about each transaction entered into the general journal.
Sub-totals are made at the end of each source code.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This will probally be the program that you use to print the auto-posting from the various systems.
Enter the source code, All for the date range, and the date the posting was done for the entry date
range.
