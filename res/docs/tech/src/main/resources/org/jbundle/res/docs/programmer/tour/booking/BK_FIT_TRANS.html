<p>If the transportation code is not passed in, then the transportation code is entered, the file is read, and
the transportation information is displayed.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If the date has not been passed in, then the date is entered. The date is used to read the correct

<p>Next, the rates are checked to see if they exist. Each transportation class is displayed and you can
select one from the list. If the prices don't exist, you can enter the amount per-person, or type zero to
