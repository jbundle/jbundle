<p>Program Description:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This program is used to print the checks requested. It prints the checks and a check register, and then
it updates the invoice balances, the General Ledger amounts, and the checking account balance.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This program is very complex, but it is very easy to operate.

<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The first item to enter is the bank account you want to print checks for.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Then you must decide whether you want to print the automated checks or print a check register for
the manually entered checks. If you select both, then the automated checks will print and the check
register will include both the automated checks and the manual checks.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The third question asks if you want to print a pre-check writing report. This report will print a draft
copy of the check register before the checks are printed. If you print this report, then the system print
the report, then ask if you want to continue.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Now the system asks you for the starting check number if checks are to be printed. The program will
ask you to load the checks into the printer before starting to print.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The system automatically prints the checks and posts the proper amounts to the General Ledger
Distribtion file.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>After the checks have been printed, a check register will print.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The General Ledger distribtion depends on the type of payment. A few samples follow:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>11/21/86  Accounts Payable - Tours       230.00

<p>              Cash                             230.00

<p>                  (Payment to a USD vendor)

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>11/21/86  Accounts Payable - Tours       920.00

<p>              Gain or Loss on Curr. exchange    20.00 (Gain)               Cash                             900.00

<p>                  (Broker payment - multiple vendors)

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>11/21/86  Prepayments to Vendors         200.00

<p>              Cash                             200.00

<p>                  (Prepayment)
