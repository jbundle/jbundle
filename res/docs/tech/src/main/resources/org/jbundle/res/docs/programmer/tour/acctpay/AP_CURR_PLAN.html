<p>Program Description:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This program tries to estimate how much currency will be required now and in the future.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>For example, you may want to run this program at the beginning of each month to estimate the
currency required in the coming month. The program will calculate the amount of money that will be
owed to vendors for all finalized tours departing during the month (This is where the finalization
estimate comes in handy). From this report, you have an idea of how much of each currency you will
have to pay each vendor next month.

<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>First enter the beginning and ending currencies to print. Pressing return prints all currencies.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Decide whether you want to see both departure estimates and finalization estimates. Usually you will
want to see both.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Enter the ranges of dates that you would like to like to classify the currency requirements. Then enter
the length of the periods to classify (ie., 7 = forcast for each week into the future). You can analyze
up to 9 periods into the future.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Printing detail will print the A/P detail for the report. Usually you would only do this after running this
report and seeing an unusual number.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Open items are analyzed as follows:

<p>-	Invoice and Credit invoices: Invoice balance added to range

<p>-	All Estimates: Estimate amount added to range

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>NOTE:	This program takes a considerable amount of time to run. It should be run during a
non-critical time.
