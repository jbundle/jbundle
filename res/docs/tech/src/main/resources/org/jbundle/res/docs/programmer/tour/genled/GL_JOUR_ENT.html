<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Upon entering this program, the batch code will display and you will be asked for a transaction
number. Hit return to enter a new transaction, otherwise enter the transaction number to edit.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>First, enter the date for the transactions to enter. Then enter the G/L account number for the
transaction to enter. After the account description displays, enter the amount for the transaction. The
amount entered will be a debit, unless you either hit return once and enter the amount in the credit
column or enter a negative amount.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If the counter-balance field in the chart account entered is set to a valid account, then you are asked
if you want to create the counter balancing entry. If the auto-distribution code is set, you will be asked
if you want to create the auto-distribution entries.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>After entering the last transaction, press return to enter the comment and the source code for the
transactions entered.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>You may make changes to any of the accounts at this point. When you press return, the transaction
will be saved in the transaction file. If the debits and credits don't equal, then you can't exit until the
tranasaction is deleted or balanced.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If the source code matches the auto-accrual reversal source code in the control file, you will be asked
if you wan't to create a reversing entry. If you answer Yes, an entry will be created with the opposite
amounts in the next transaction number.
