<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This program updates the MCO status from submited to paid. The MCOs entered in MCO collection
entry are update in this program.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Note: The G/L posting is done in the cash receipts program. If the amount received is different from the total
MCO amount, then the difference is posted to the MCO variance account (Income/Expense). The
total MCO amount is always posted to the A/R account.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If the difference in an MCO is collected later, just enter the MCO as a new sales, with the distribution
(income) going to the variance account. This will provide the most accurate reflection of the
transaction.
