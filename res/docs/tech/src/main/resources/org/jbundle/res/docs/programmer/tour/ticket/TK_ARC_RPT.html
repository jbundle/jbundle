<p>Program Description:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This program prints a list of all the tickets issued, changed, and cancelled each week to be used for
the weekly ARC sales report.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Enter the ticketing date of the last ticket to process in the ARC sales report. ARC Accounts Receivable
Summary account number will display.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>All tickets with a status of "Ticketed" and without an ARC update date with a ticketing date before
or on the entered date will be included in this report. The system will ask if the tickets printed match
the tickets sent to the ARC. If you answer Yes, the ticket's ARC update date will be set to the system
date.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The G/L transaction done for the issue date is as follows:

<p>12/31/90	Prepaid Tickets			1000.00

<p>			Accounts Receivable - ARC		1000.00

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>When you enter the automatic transfer in Accounts Payable, use the same A/R account, so the
transaction will be:

<p>12/31/90	Accounts Receivable - ARC	1000.00

<p>			Cash						1000.00

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Tickets which have been changed or cancelled are also included on this report. The resulting G/L
transactions is similar to the transaction for tickets.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Note: Although air purchased with a credit card is more likely to be paid for with an MCO, it is
possible for the credit portion of the ticket to be validated by a wholesaler. For example, in the
previous example, The ticket face value (with taxes) was 1075.00, leaving $75.00 of commissions to
be collected from the ARC. The $1075 was colected directly from the customer by using the credit
form on the ticket. The Issue transaction would be the same:

<p>12/31/90	Prepaid Tickets			1000.00

<p>			Accounts Receivable - ARC		1000.00

<p>The ARC transaction would be:

<p>12/31/90	Cash						  75.00

<p>			Accounts Receivable - ARC		  75.00

<p>Because there would be no cash payment, a debit memo must be entered into A/R, with the
distribution reducing the receivable to the ARC:

<p>12/31/90	Accounts Receivable - ARC	1075.00

<p>			Accounts Receivable - FITs		1075.00

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In any case, the ARC Receivable account is only a control account, all transactions will eventually zero
out this account.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Note: If you change the ARC summary account be careful try to do it before you do the A/R posting.
It is possible to post issued tickets until the end of a period (with the original ARC acct), then change
the ARC acct and run the ARC report with the new ARC number. All transactions after the end of
the period would have the new ARC A/R acct. You would then use the ticket tranaction review report
to set up the distribution for the ARC payment.
