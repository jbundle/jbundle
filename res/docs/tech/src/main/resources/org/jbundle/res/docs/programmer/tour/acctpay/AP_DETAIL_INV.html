<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>First, type in the vendor code, then answer the question, "Display confirmed vouchers?"

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The system displays information on all the invoices, credit invoices, credit memos, and prepayment
requests for this vendor. If you want confirmed vouchers to display, all the confirmed vouchers
(finalization estimates), manual finalization estimates, and departure estimates for this vendor will also
display. This can be useful if you have to pre-pay a vendor.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>They will be grouped by type and displayed by the starting services date.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Note:	If you also want to see the vendor account status, including Prepayments and Debit memos,
use the Vendor Account Inquiry program on the main-menu.
