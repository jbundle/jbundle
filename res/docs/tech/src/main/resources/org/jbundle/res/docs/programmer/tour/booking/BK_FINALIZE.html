<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Documentation can be printed on the:

<p>	1 - Booking date

<p>	2 - Date deposit is received

<p>	3 - Date all services are confirmed ("OK")

<p>	4 - Date final payment is received

<p>	5 - Tour Finalization date (Close tour) (AP also updated) 	6 - Final Documents date (Send

<p>	8 - Special date 1

<p>	9 - Special date 2

<p>	10- Departure date (AP, AR, GL, TK, TOUR and BK also U/D)

<p>	11- Cancellation date (Documentation to be processed)

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Some dates do special updating:

<p>	5 - Tour Finalization date

<p>		- Check all bookings are paid in full and status = OK

<p>		- Write/update all of the A/P estimates for the tour

<p>	7 - Ticketing date

<p>		- Transfer information to be ticketed to ticketing

<p>	10- Departure date

<p>		- Update agency sales, type information

<p>		- Write/update all A/P departure estimates

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The finalization knows what to print by the Documentation file maintenance screen in the tour header
maintenance. When the action date comes up, the system looks at the documentation file to see what
should be printed on this date. After the documents have been created, the action date is set to the next
item in the documentation file.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The finalization system knows what format to use for a document by the text file name in the
document screen. If the name is blank, the system uses the name in the header file and if that name
is blank, the system will use the default in the booking control file. If the filename is a number, then
the corresponding default format will be used.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The finalization knows how to scan the file information by the document type code in the
documentation screen. The following table lists all the document type codes:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Order			Code	Examples

<p>TOUR,HOTEL

<p>			R	Hotel Request form (internal)

<p>			H	Hotel Tour Orders

<p>			V	Hotel Vouchers

<p>TOUR,LAND VENDOR

<p>			S	Land &amp; Transportation Request form

<p>			L	Land &amp; Transportation Tour Orders

<p>			W	Land &amp; Transportation Vouchers

<p>TOUR,AIR

<p>			Q	Air Request form (internal)

<p>			T	Ticket Request form (internal)

<p>TOUR,BOOKING

<p>			B	Booking Confirmation

<p>			I	Tour Itinerary

<p>			C	Tour Checklist

<p>TOUR,BOOKING,PAX

<p>			P	Passenger list

<p> 			O	Rooming list

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	NOTE: On the Finalization date, before anything is run, the system will check every booking to make sure
that they are paid in full and the status is OK.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	NOTE: On the Finalization date, A/P is updated before the documentation is printed. This way the A/P
voucher reference number can be included on the tour orders. This will make payments much easier.
This also updates A/P so prepayments can be made.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	NOTE: On the ticketing date, the ticketing information is transfered to the ticketing system for each passenger
(if it is not there already). The ticketing system will handle it from there. It will print the tickets or the
ticket requests and keep track of commissions and overrides.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If a booking is modified or cancelled after tour documents have been sent, the tour finalization is
scheculed to re-run.  This program will create all of the back-documents and compare them to the
versions at the original date. If they are different, then the system will and print ** Revised ** on the
new documents.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Usually, this program will run in a batch nightly. In the morning, operators will load each type of paper
and print the documents which were created during the run.
