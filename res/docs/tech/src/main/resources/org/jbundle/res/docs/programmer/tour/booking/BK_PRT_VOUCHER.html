<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Usually tour vouchers are processed automatically by the finalization system. This program is used to
manually print a particular voucher. A voucher will print even if the status says that it has already been
printed.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>First, the system will ask you for a voucher number to print.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Next, you will be asked if you want to print the hotel or land voucher. If you answer Yes, you will
have to enter the tour document type code. This code determines whether the status on a voucher will
be updated after it is printed. The default entry updates the status, any other entry will cause the entry
not to be updated. Next, you will be asked for the voucher format and the form to print the voucher
on (type "T" to set up a telex). The voucher will automatically print.
