<p>Program Operation:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If the agency has been entered already, then it will display.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>First the program asks for the Agency ARC number.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If 0 is typed, then this is a manual entry, a direct booking, or an agency without an ARC number.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The agency may also be searched by zip code and agency's name.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If the agency isn't found by their ARC number, you will be given the chance to enter it.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Once the agent is displayed, the information can be changed (Agency file will automatically be
updated).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If you type DEL at the ANY CHANGE prompt, then all the agency information will be cleared from
this booking and you will be prompted for the ARC number again. This does not affect the agency
master file.
