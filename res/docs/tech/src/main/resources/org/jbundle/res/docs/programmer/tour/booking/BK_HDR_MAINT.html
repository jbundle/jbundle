<p>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The major reason for this file is to differentiate a tour program from one year to the next, although
this screen can easily be used to keep track of major changes in a tour during the year. This lets the
system know which prices, air, etc. go with which year's tour.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>To enter the seasonal prices, use the alternate entry screen, and enter an alternate entry that selects
based on date. Then go to the pricing screen and enter the applicable prices.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>First, enter the tour code under number 1 on the screen. The tour file header with the current ending
date will display. Then all of the header descriptions with an ending date which is greater than the
system date will display.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>You can change any of the date ranges or descriptions on the screen.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>NOTE:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Internally, the ALT_OR_OPT code is blank, the ALT_SEQ is entered, the SELECT_BY is D(ate),
the QUESTION text is blank, the ALT_ANSW_SEQ is zero (this type file must be unique by date),
the DATES are entered, the ANSWER_TEXT contains the comment, and the ALT_USE_SEQ is
never used.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The ALT_SEQ is (will be) automatically assigned by the system. (For now, the user will have to enter
a unique sequence number and use that sequence number with an answer sequence of zero)
