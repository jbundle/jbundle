/**
  * A demo for illustrating how to do different things with JTree.
  * The data that this displays is rather boring, that is each node will
  * have 7 children that have random names based on the fonts.  Each node
  * is then drawn with that font and in a different color.
  * While the data isn't interesting the example illustrates a number
  * of things:
  *
  * For an example of dynamicaly loading children refer to DynamicTreeNode.
  * For an example of adding/removing/inserting/reloading refer to the inner
  *     classes of this class, AddAction, RemovAction, InsertAction and
  *     ReloadAction.
  * For an example of creating your own cell renderer refer to
  *     SampleTreeCellRenderer.
  * For an example of subclassing JTreeModel for editing refer to
  *     SampleTreeModel.
